# Task Plan: Windows Dynamic Wallpaper V1

## Goal
Implement a Windows 10/11 dynamic wallpaper app from an empty repo with strict performance-first architecture (WorkerW + MF + D3D11), plus tests for core logic.

## Current Phase
Phase 5

## Phases
### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- [x] Capture user goals and hard constraints
- [x] Lock architecture and acceptance targets
- [x] Initialize planning memory files
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: TDD Red Phase
- [x] Create failing tests for config, scheduler, and arbiter
- [x] Verify failures are caused by missing behavior
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Green Phase Implementation
- [x] Implement core modules to pass tests
- [x] Implement Windows host/decode/render integration skeleton
- [x] Build app entrypoint and platform stubs
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Verification
- [x] Run tests and collect results
- [x] Validate test script for local repeatability
- [x] Update findings and progress logs
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 5: Delivery
- [x] Review created files and architecture boundaries
- [x] Deliver implementation notes and limitations
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 6: Performance Hardening (In Progress)
- [x] Add tray context menu exit path
- [x] Add virtual desktop multi-monitor render coverage
- [x] Add MF-driven decode timeline with fallback ticker
- [ ] Bind real decoded video frame texture to renderer
- **Status:** in_progress

## Key Questions
1. Can we keep decode/render pipeline modular while maintaining zero-copy path readiness? (Yes)
2. What minimal UI/control surface delivers usability without performance penalty? (Tray loop skeleton ready)

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Windows-only V1 | Best chance to hit extreme performance target |
| C++20 + Win32 + MF + D3D11 | Maximum low-level control and efficiency |
| Default 30 FPS, optional 60 FPS | Balance smoothness and power |
| Pause on fullscreen | Guarantee no foreground stutter |
| g++ test script fallback | Current shell lacks cmake in PATH |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| cmake not found in PATH | 1 | Added `scripts/run_tests.ps1` using g++ |
| MinGW link failed (`FOLDERID_LocalAppData` / `WinMain`) | 1 | Switched to `SHGetFolderPathW` and added dual entrypoints (`main` + `wWinMain`) |
| `shellapi.h` compile break in tray module | 1 | Fixed include order (`windows.h` before `shellapi.h`) and icon resource loading |
| `GUID_NULL` unresolved in MinGW MF path | 1 | Replaced with local zero-initialized GUID constant |

## Notes
- Enforce TDD for each new behavior.
- Keep modules split when readability threshold is exceeded.
